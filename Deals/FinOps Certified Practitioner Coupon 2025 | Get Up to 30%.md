## What Is FinOps Certification?

FinOps, short for **Cloud Financial Operations**, is a cultural and operational framework that helps organizations maximize the value of their cloud investments.

It’s like DevOps but for cloud costs—bringing together engineering, finance, and business teams to make smarter, data-driven decisions.

This certification is ideal for:

- **FinOps Analysts**, Cloud Architects, and Cloud Cost Optimization Managers
- **Finance and Procurement** professionals supporting cloud operations
- **IT Leaders** driving cloud-first strategies
- **Sales and Marketing** pros working for FinOps tooling vendors

With cloud spending soaring (organizations spent **$1.3 trillion** on cloud services in 2024), FinOps skills are a game-changer.

The FOCP certification, offered by the FinOps Foundation, is valid for **24 months** and comes with a digital Credly badge to flaunt on LinkedIn.
