## CKA Certification Preparation Guide

Preparing for the CKA exam requires a structured approach combining theoretical knowledge, hands-on practice, and familiarity with the exam environment.

The CKA is a 2-hour, online, proctored exam based on Kubernetes v1.32 (as of April 2025), with tasks performed via the command line.

The passing score is 66%, and the exam tests your ability to solve practical problems across multiple Kubernetes clusters. Key preparation steps include:

- **Understand the Syllabus**: Familiarize yourself with the five domains: Cluster Architecture, Installation & Configuration (25%), Workloads & Scheduling (15%), Services & Networking (20%), Storage (10%), and Troubleshooting (30%).
- **Hands-On Practice**: Use platforms like Killer.sh, KodeKloud, or Minikube to simulate real-world Kubernetes tasks.
- **Leverage Official Resources**: The Kubernetes documentation (kubernetes.io) is your go-to resource during the open-book exam.
- **Mock Exams**: Practice with exam simulators to build speed and confidence.

## CKA Exam Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites for the CKA exam, but candidates should have:

- A solid understanding of Linux command-line operations (e.g., vi, systemctl, grep).
- Familiarity with Kubernetes core concepts (e.g., Pods, Deployments, Services).
- Basic knowledge of containerization (e.g., Docker) and networking.
- Experience with kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool.

While prior certifications like CKAD are not required, they can provide a strong foundation for CKA preparation.

### CKA Exam Details

The CKA exam is a performance-based test conducted online via PSI’s secure browser, proctored remotely with audio, video, and screen-sharing feeds.

### CKA Exam Syllabus

The CKA syllabus is divided into five domains, each with specific weightings and objectives. Below is an overview of the key topics:

- **Cluster Architecture, Installation & Configuration (25%)**: Managing RBAC, installing clusters with kubeadm, ensuring high availability, provisioning infrastructure, upgrading clusters, and implementing etcd backups.
- **Workloads & Scheduling (15%)**: Configuring static pods, deployments, ConfigMaps, Secrets, scaling applications, and understanding resource limits.
- **Services & Networking (20%)**: Configuring host networking, pod connectivity, service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer), Ingress, CoreDNS, and CNI plugins.
- **Storage (10%)**: Managing storage classes, persistent volumes, volume modes, access modes, and reclaim policies.
- **Troubleshooting (30%)**: Evaluating logs, monitoring applications, and troubleshooting application, cluster, and networking issues.

**Note**: The syllabus will change on February 10, 2025, so plan to take the exam before this date or prepare for the updated topics.

## CKA Practice Labs

Hands-on practice is critical for CKA success. Recommended platforms include:

- **Killer.sh**: Provides two 36-hour exam simulator sessions with 17 questions each, mimicking the real exam environment.
- **KodeKloud**: Offers interactive labs and mock exams with instant feedback.
- **Minikube**: A local Kubernetes cluster for practicing cluster setup and management.
- **Kubernetes the Hard Way**: A manual setup guide by Kelsey Hightower to deepen your understanding of Kubernetes components.

Set up a practice cluster using kubeadm or a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) to simulate real-world scenarios. Focus on tasks like creating pods, upgrading clusters, and troubleshooting failures.

## Kubectl Aliases & Shortnames

Speed is crucial in the CKA exam, and using kubectl aliases and short names can save valuable time. The exam environment includes pre-configured aliases (e.g., k for kubectl) and autocompletion. Common shortcuts include:

- po for Pods
- Deploy for Deployments
- svc for Services
- cm for ConfigMaps
- ns for Namespaces

Example commands:

```
k get po -n kube-system

k describe deploy my-app

k create svc clusterip my-service-- tcp=80
```

Practice these shortcuts to navigate the command line efficiently during the exam.

## Guide to CKA Exam: A Syllabus-Based Approach

A syllabus-based study plan ensures you cover all exam objectives systematically. Break your preparation into weekly goals:

- **Week 1–2**: Study cluster architecture, kubeadm setup, and RBAC.
- **Week 3**: Focus on workloads, deployments, and scaling.
- **Week 4**: Master networking, services, and Ingress.
- **Week 5**: Dive into storage and persistent volumes.
- **Week 6**: Practice troubleshooting and take mock exams.
